    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chocolate chip bread is from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com">allrecipes.com</a>. I tried it out and it tasted like home so I am recommending it here! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass. </li>
        <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl. </li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. </li>
        <li>Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just blended. Fold in chocolate chips; pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. </li>
        <li>Step 8 is ...well there's no step 8, you just <strong>slice and enjoy! </strong></li>
    </ol>
