        <h2>Description</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li> Take a small lump of ginger, peel it, and slice it thinly.  </li>
            <li>Thinly slice your lemons and sundry it. </li>
            <li>In a hot, oil-free pan, fry the ginger until it becomes lightly brown. </li>
            <li>Next, add a cup of rice and stir to combine.Don't fry it till the rice turns black (we are making ginger tea here, not burned rice tea) </li>
        </ol>
           <p>Prepare hot water in your tea pot, add about a handful of your ginger-tea, a pinch of salt and one dried slime and let it steep for about 3 minutes. </p>
